    <h1>Directives</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Directives are markup on the DOM that links parts of the DOM with some javascript</li>
        <li>These can be used to attach behavior to the DOM, or to transform a DOM element and its children</li>
        <li>Directives appear as custom html elements or attributes, or as css classes</li>
        <li>Angular's html compiler identifies these, and links the DOM components to the javascript scope</li>
        <li>Angular comes with a set of built-in directives</li>
        <li>You can create your own directives</li>
    </ul>
