    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Most of the magic is in the DOM compiler</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Angular is bootstrapped just after the browser loads the DOM</li>
            <li>The entire DOM is parsed, looking for Angular syntax</li>
            <li>The DOM is modified in place (as necessary) to attach behavior</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Angular gets most of its power as an extension of the DOM</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Angular consumes the DOM, not string templates</li>
            <li>This two way linking results in a "live view"</li>
            <li>The binding is transparent. The developer does not need to make any special calls to refresh the view</li>
            <li>Other templating frameworks try to work around the DOM, with less impressive results.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Consume a static string template</li>
                <li>Combine it with data to produce a new string</li>
                <li>Inject the new string back into an element using <code>innerHTML</code></li>
                <li>Any changes to the data model require the template to be re-processed</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
