    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Most of the magic is in the DOM compiler</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Angular is bootstrapped just after the browser loads the DOM</li>
            <li>The entire DOM is parsed, looking for Angular syntax</li>
            <li>The DOM is modified in place (as necessary) to attach behavior</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Angular gets most of its power as an extension of the DOM</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Other frameworks try to work around the DOM, with less impressive results</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
